## 3. Core Problems We Solve

### 🔴 The "Black Box" of Transport
*   **Problem:** Parents have no idea where the bus is or if their child reached safely.
*   **Solution:** Real-time GPS tracking and instant WhatsApp/SMS notifications for boarding/deboarding.

### 🔴 Revenue Leakage
*   **Problem:** Operators rely on cash/manual logs. Fees are often missed, delayed, or pilfered.
*   **Solution:** Automated "Fees & Payment Engine" with WhatsApp reminders, digital receipts, and strict ledger tracking.

### 🔴 Chaotic Operations
*   **Problem:** Manual route planning, driver absenteeism, and breakdown mismanagement.
*   **Solution:** Automated route optimization, driver performance tracking, and digital maintenance logs.

3.  **Offline-First PWA:** The driver app works seamlessly even in low-network areas, syncing data when connectivity returns.
4.  **Hyper-Local Customization:** Built for the Indian context (UPI integration, regional language support - Hindi/Marathi, WhatsApp receipts).
